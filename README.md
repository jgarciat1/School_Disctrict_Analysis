# School_Disctrict_Analysis
In this weekly challenge, we analyzed the grade differences between charter schools and public schools

## Answer to deliverable 6
After performing the analysis, we saw some interesting results in the data in variable 5, when we dig deeper into the data.

Towards the end, we see that the average reading and math scores aren't all that different between public and charter schools. Charter Schools' only advantage on public schools is a 2% difference on the school's average mean reading scores.

Another discovery is seniors at charter schools lose focus on their math scores as that is where public schools have a 4% advantage. Regardless, charter schools have the overall advantage on public schools as they average a 7.66% advantage between 9th and 11th grade.

Some additional analysis that could be beneficial is digging deeper into the funding that each school receives vs their average scores. Also, seeing the location of the schools in relation to the average grades could be interesting as we could see if their environment plays a role in the grades.
